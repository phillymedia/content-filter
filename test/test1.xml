 <![CDATA[<p>The ancient trees in a primeval New Jersey forest have <i>seen</i> some things. They’re 400 to 500 years old, after all. But now, thanks to sea rise, they’re under threat. My colleague Frank Kummer’s report on the trees' troubles is a fascinating look at how climate change is impacting our environment. Much, <i>much</i> closer to home, we’ve got some advice for you this morning about how to deal with your seasonal gut issues. Yes, you can have too much holiday fun, and it could have a bigger impact on how you feel than you might think.</p> <p><i>— Aubrey Nagle (</i><a href="https://twitter.com/aubsn"><i>@aubsn</i></a><i>, </i><a href="mailto:morningnewsletter@philly.com"><i>morningnewsletter@philly.com</i></a><i>)</i></p> <img class="full-width" alt="" src="https://dixon.philly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/600-x-100-Morning-Briefing-Ad_Sponsored-by-Independence-1200x200.jpg"/> <figcaption> <div class="label-caption-rss"> </div> </figcaption> <h2 class="bold h2 pad pad-top pad-md"> <a href="http://www2.philly.com/science/climate/a/climate-change-sea-level-rise-nj-natural-lands-glades-wildlife-refuge-sourgum-trees-20181211.html">How sea rise threatens 500-year-old trees in a primeval New Jersey forest</a></h2> <img class="full-width" alt="The edge of a lake, a former mining pit, now filled with water with a relatively high degree of salinity.
